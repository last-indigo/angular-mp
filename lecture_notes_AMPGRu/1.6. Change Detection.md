## AMPGRu1.6: Change Detection

```
@Component({
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```
CAREFULLY! use only when immutable

### Immutable suggestions:
Object.assign, Object.freeze,
ImmutableJS

Immutable - requirement only for input parameters.

Observables - promises on steroids, with richer API

changeDetector.markForCheck()
- to reflect changes in component, marking the path to the top (root component)

### SUMMARY for CD (Change Detection):
1. CD tree passes only once in a time
2. onPush fires only for immutable input params (different references), or when we call CD on our own.
3. onPush has great performance: it allows to eliminate CD in a other component tree parts.
4. CD has own compiler, which compiles html to high-performance JS:
avoids deep object properties checking/comparison.
5. remember about unidirectional data flow (and, related: onPush + immutable)
