## AMPGRu1.6: Change Detection

Each component has its own change detector.

Changes go top to bottom.

Check everything! A2 runs all CD's every single time.

Ensure components do follow _idempotence rule_ (not causing side effects?)

Backdoor error: `expression has changed after it was checked`.  
When child changes parent directly.
Because CD doesn't return back, it cannot track changes
that were happened after CD went a level down.
> Conclusion: (**to be verified**)
do not change properties of @Inputs 
in a setter of another @Input in child

No DOM access happens, until change is detected.

NgFactory files === Change detectors for each component.

`<NgFactory_NAME>.prototype.detectChangesInternal()`

Zone.JS - allows to re-define, how async tasks are registered.
(i.e. decorating them, or, monkey-patch async events)  
It's an execution context that allows to put hooks onto async tasks.

NgZone: 
runOutside - throttle (1 / 5 sec)

`this.changeDetectorRefs.forEach( detector => detector.detectChanges() `
can call CD manually


```
@Component({
  changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush
})
```
CAREFULLY! use only when immutable

### Immutable suggestions:
Object.assign, Object.freeze,
ImmutableJS

Immutable - requirement only for input parameters.

Observables - promises on steroids, with richer API

changeDetector.markForCheck()
- to reflect changes in component, marking the path to the top (root component)

### SUMMARY for CD (Change Detection):
1. CD tree passes only once in a time
2. onPush fires only for immutable input params (different references), or when we call CD on our own.
3. onPush has great performance: it allows to eliminate CD in a other component tree parts.
4. CD has own compiler, which compiles html to high-performance JS:
avoids deep object properties checking/comparison.
5. remember about unidirectional data flow (and, related: onPush + immutable)
