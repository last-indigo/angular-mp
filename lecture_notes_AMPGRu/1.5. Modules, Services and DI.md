## AMPGRu1.5: Modules, Services and DI

(to be verified)
Common module from '@angular/common':
contains ngFor, ngIf etc.

Components do not require its own module:
one module can declare multiple components.

Providers become available to the importing module 
automatically: no need to add to add them to 'exports'.

Lazy-loading: child injector for lazy modules.

Core module: has to be imported into root modules and 
be protected from being imported to any other module.

Shared 
```
import * as components from './components'

imports: [
  ...toArray(angularModules)
],
declarations: [
  ...toArray(components)
],
exports: [
  ...toArray(angularModules),
  ...toArray(components)
]
```

### forRoot
Technique to have singleton providers.
(hide providers from being created
 in lazy modules's child injectors)
So we will have two options for module import: 
- without providers (for lazy)
- with providers (for root)

Calling this method will attach providers,
but just importing it will only import exported declarables.

So instead of 
```
@NgModule({
  providers: [...]
})
```
use 

```
export class SharedModule {
  static forRoot(): ModuleWithProviders {
    return {
      ngModule: SharedModule,
      providers: [...]
    }
  }
}
```
And import to root app as such:
```
  imports: [ SharedModule.forRoot() ]
```


### @OpaqueToken
Inject non-class dependencies
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html#!#non-class-dependencies
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/OpaqueToken-class.html

### DI and Token for services
```
...
  providers: [
    {provide: <TOKEN>, useClass: MyService}
  ]
...
```
If `<TOKEN>` is a string, e.g. `{provide: 'tokenString', useClass: MyService}`
Then, usage is: `@Inject('tokenString')` in constructor of other places.

### @Optional

### Multi-token singleton
Several tokens can reference same singleton entity.

Q: what is best practice for re-exported components?

A: (to be verified)
```
import * as components from './components';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    ...Array.from(components)
  ]
})
```
Or: export module in @NgModule().exports
```
  imports: [ AModule ],
  declarations: [ b1, b2 ],
  exports: [ b1, AModule ]
```

----
Q:
>  how to encapsulate service's dependencies being located in other modules?
I want service to be self-contained.
The example was that we have to delegate module imports to root (app)module.
e.g. service that depends on Http service from HttpModule,
and the service cannot be used until HttpModule is imported to root.
Maybe @Injectable can declare its own modules to import, that it needs?

Q:
> When and where does the provider configuration happen?

A: (to be verified)
```
  ...
  providers: [
    {provider: MyService, useClass: FakeMyService}
  ]
  ...
```
**Especially useful in unit-tests for mocking.**
