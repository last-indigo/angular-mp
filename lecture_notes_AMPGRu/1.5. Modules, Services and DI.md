## AMPGRu1.5: Modules, Services and DI
### forRoot
Technique to have singleton providers

### @OpaqueToken
Inject non-class dependencies
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/dependency-injection.html#!#non-class-dependencies
https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/api/core/index/OpaqueToken-class.html

### DI and Token for services
```
...
  providers: [
    {provide: <TOKEN>, useClass: MyService}
  ]
...
```
If `<TOKEN>` is a string, e.g. `{provide: 'tokenString', useClass: MyService}`
Then, usage is: `@Inject('tokenString')` in constructor of other places.

### Multi-token singleton
Several tokens can reference same singleton entity.

Q:
>  how to encapsulate service's dependencies being located in other modules?
I want service to be self-contained.
The example was that we have to delegate module imports to root (app)module.
e.g. service that depends on Http service from HttpModule,
and the service cannot be used until HttpModule is imported to root.
Maybe @Injectable can declare its own modules to import, that it needs?

Q:

A: (to be verified)
```
  ...
  providers: [
    {provider: MyService, useClass: FakeMyService}
  ]
  ...
```
**Especially useful in unit-tests for mocking.**
