1. import Router module, add it to imports with
 RouterModule.forRoot(routes, CONFIG)

2. route interface:
- path
  - can contain path params (tokens with ":", e.g. 'path/:id')
- component
- redirectTo
- canActivate/canDeactivate/canLoad (can load - useful for lazy modules)
- pathMatch: 
  - 'full' (mainly, for `path: ''`) 
  - 'prefix'
- data (??? is it standard ??? )
- children[] array of routes
  (will work if routed component has own router-outlet)


routerLink:
```
./home - current 
../home - parent 
/home - baseUrl 
```

`<router-outlet>`

baseUrl: `<base href='/'>`

1.x - had resolvers, 2.x - has guards
Guards are placed into `providers` of the module.

canActivate - blocks from entering (e.g. unauth user)

canDeactivate - blocks from exit (e.g. form data, confirmation before leave)
This guard accepts 3(three) parameters:
- component of specific type
- snapshot
- ???

Lazy-loading is handled by router.
We do NOT define any of the lazy parts in app module,
those will be defined in that lazy module, so we only define path to it:
`path: 'admin', loadChildren: () => 'path/to/lazy.module'`
Might need to use `System.import('path')` in older starter kits.

Lazy module can define its own routes via `RouterModule.forChild(routes)`

ActivatedRoute service
  - this.route.params: Observable
  
Navigate from class:
  - router: Router
  this.router.navigate('path', ['params', 's'])
